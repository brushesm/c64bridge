# VICE Support Matrix

This document is the source of truth for VICE support in the public MCP surface.

## Decision Rules

- `supported`: part of the public VICE contract, enforced at runtime, documented in generated compatibility tables, and covered by regression tests.
- `mock-only experimental`: may exist in test scaffolding or backend experiments, but must not appear as supported in public MCP metadata or README compatibility tables.
- `unsupported`: blocked at runtime on VICE with `unsupported_platform`.

## Phase-One Decisions

- Resource-backed VICE drive operations are supported in phase one: `list_drives`, `mount`, `unmount`, `reset`, `power_on`, `power_off`, and `set_mode`.
- Grouped operations already declared c64u-only remain c64u-only on VICE and must be blocked at runtime.
- Mock-only behavior must not appear in public compatibility tables before it is intentionally promoted to supported status.
- For this phase, there are no public `mock-only experimental` operations in the grouped MCP contract. Any such behavior remains internal to tests or backend experiments until explicitly reclassified here.

## Notes

- `supported` means supported on the public grouped MCP surface. It does not imply parity with Ultimate firmware internals.
- VICE still has platform limits such as `no-rest-api`, `no-firmware-filesystem`, `no-flash-config`, and `limited-sid`.
- When this matrix changes, update runtime enforcement, tests, README-generated compatibility tables, and generated `mcp/*.json` artifacts together.
